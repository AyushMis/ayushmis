								<h3>e-Healthcare Advisor</h3>
							</header>
							<p>e-Healthcare Advisor is a project build to benefit Doctors, Patients and even hospitals by providing a direct way to have a healthy communication between them without much loss of time.

								<h3>Chat Application</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This Chat Application is much more efficient from others because we have mainly focussed on the algorithm used to have a much more reliable connection between the clients. This Chat App is based on Python programming language for setting up the connection i.e using sockets .</p>

								<h3>Game Of Life</h3>
							</header>
							<p>It's a very interesting game played between two people which is based on the very popular theory of Cellular Automaton described by John Conway. This theory comes under the topic of Theory of Computation which consists of many basic and complex theories. This game have few simple rules as told by Conway in his theories which will somehow lead to develop intelligence among the computers.</p>

								<h3>Automatic Vending Machine</h3>
							</header>
							<p>AVM is a machine used to automatically dispense items when a minimum amount of money is inserted first. Since these kind of machines are needed in many places therefore their production has to be increased effeciently. We have incorporated some basic ICs as well as some complex one too. Flip-Flop played a vital role in this project which is used for memorization in digital machines.</p>

								<h3>Weighted Pagerank Algorithm</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In this research paper, me with one of my collegue Utkarsh Shukla developed a new algorithm to find algorithm for finding Web Pageranks. In this approach we have considered the weight of each page and then efficiently calculated the ranks using MATLAB Software for programming purpose.</p>

								<h3>Face and Feature detection from playing Video</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Since the field of image processing is trending now-a-days and needs a lot of work to be done. Me and my friend Utkarsh Jain under our faculty coordinator are currently on this project of feature detection and finally analysing them for generalizing the results coming out from our ananlysis. </p>
